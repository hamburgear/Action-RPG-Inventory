add_item_to_inventory
- Pixels to ID
- Offset is very important to computation of Pixels to ID
- I start in Y because it is the row, then X for the column

sorting precedence
- longer y first
- longer x with respect to y size
- placement
	- Column top to bottom
	- Row left to right
	- then check for vacancies - check from unplaced item appropriate size

Warning:
- connect must follow signal's signature
- collisionshape boundary - triggering - less 1 pixel each side
